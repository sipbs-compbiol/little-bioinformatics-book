  title     = "{MAFFT}: a novel method for rapid multiple sequence alignment
               based on fast Fourier transform",
  author    = "Katoh, Kazutaka and Misawa, Kazuharu and Kuma, Kei-Ichi and
               Miyata, Takashi",
  abstract  = "A multiple sequence alignment program, MAFFT, has been
               developed. The CPU time is drastically reduced as compared with
               existing methods. MAFFT includes two novel techniques. (i) Homo
               logous regions are rapidly identified by the fast Fourier
               transform (FFT), in which an amino acid sequence is converted to
               a sequence composed of volume and polarity values of each amino
               acid residue. (ii) We propose a simplified scoring system that
               performs well for reducing CPU time and increasing the accuracy
               of alignments even for sequences having large insertions or
               extensions as well as distantly related sequences of similar
               length. Two different heuristics, the progressive method
               (FFT-NS-2) and the iterative refinement method (FFT-NS-i), are
               implemented in MAFFT. The performances of FFT-NS-2 and FFT-NS-i
               were compared with other methods by computer simulations and
               benchmark tests; the CPU time of FFT-NS-2 is drastically reduced
               as compared with CLUSTALW with comparable accuracy. FFT-NS-i is
               over 100 times faster than T-COFFEE, when the number of input
               sequences exceeds 60, without sacrificing the accuracy.",

  abstract  = "Here, we describe a web server that integrates structural
               alignments with the MAFFT multiple sequence alignment (MSA)
               tool. For this purpose, we have prepared a web-based Database of
               Aligned Structural Homologs (DASH), which provides structural
               alignments at the domain and chain levels for all proteins in
               the Protein Data Bank (PDB), and can be queried interactively or
               by a simple REST-like API. MAFFT-DASH integration can be invoked
               with a single flag on either the web
               (https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/) or command-line
               versions of MAFFT. In our benchmarks using 878 cases from the
               BAliBase, HomFam, OXFam, Mattbench and SISYPHUS datasets,
               MAFFT-DASH showed 10-20\% improvement over standard MAFFT for
               MSA problems with weak similarity, in terms of Sum-of-Pairs
               (SP), a measure of how well a program succeeds at aligning input
               sequences in comparison to a reference alignment. When MAFFT
               alignments were supplemented with homologous sequences, further
               improvement was observed. Potential applications of DASH beyond
               MSA enrichment include functional annotation through detection
               of remote homology and assembly of template libraries for
               homology modeling.",

               recent advances in sequencing technologies, huge numbers of
               biological sequences are available and the need for MSAs with
               large numbers of sequences is increasing. To extract
               biologically relevant information from such data, sophistication
               of algorithms is necessary but not sufficient. Intuitive and
               interactive tools for experimental biologists to
               semiautomatically handle large data are becoming important. We
               are working on development of MAFFT toward these two directions.
               Here, we explain (i) the Web interface for recently developed

  abstract  = "A progressive alignment method is described that utilizes the
               Needleman and Wunsch pairwise alignment algorithm iteratively to
               achieve the multiple alignment of a set of protein sequences and
               to construct an evolutionary tree depicting their relationship.
               The sequences are assumed a priori to share a common ancestor,
               and the trees are constructed from difference matrices derived
               directly from the multiple alignment. The thrust of the method
               involves putting more trust in the comparison of recently
               diverged sequences than in those evolved in the distant past. In
               particular, this rule is followed: ``once a gap, always a gap''.
               The method has been applied to three sets of protein sequences:
               7 superoxide dismutases, 11 globins, and 9 tyrosine kinase-like
               sequences. Multiple alignments and phylogenetic trees for these
               sets of sequences were determined and compared with trees
               derived by conventional pairwise treatments. In several
               instances, the progressive method led to trees that appeared to
               be more in line with biological expectations than were trees
               obtained by more commonly used methods.",
