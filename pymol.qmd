# `PyMOL` {#sec-PyMOL .numbered}

`PyMOL` is a widely-used, open source molecular visualisation package, with paid-for ("incentive") support and updates.

## Where can I download `PyMOL`?

The official home of `PyMOL` is at Schrodinger Software, where you can download the "Incentive" version. This requires a licence, which is free for educational use, but not free for academic/commercial/research use.

- [https://pymol.org/2/](https://pymol.org/2/)

There is an open-source, freely-licensed version of `PyMOL`, also provided by Schrodinger Software. This can be downloaded from `GitHub` and self-compiled, or obtained through `homebrew`:

- [https://github.com/schrodinger/pymol-open-source](https://github.com/schrodinger/pymol-open-source)
- [https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/pymol](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/pymol)

## Using `PyMOL`

Start the program from the application icon, or from the command-line (depending on which version you have installed), to obtain the landing screen (@fig-pymol_landing).

### `PyMOL` layout

Pymol is laid out approximately into four quadrants. Clockwise from top left in @fig-pymol_landing we have:

- The **interactive command window**. At the bottom of this window is the command prompt `PyMOL >`, where commands to control the visualisation can be typed and executed.
- The next quadrant (top right) contains a set of **function buttons** providing a range of actions for control of the visualisation.
- Below this is the **object control panel**, which is the main point-and-click interface for changing the way that molecules in the visualisation window appear, and below this is the mouse control legend to explain what your mouse/trackpad actions will achieve.
- Finally, at bottom left, we have the **main viewer window**, where your molecule will be shown.

## Obtaining structures

`PyMOL` can connect directly to [RCSB/PDB](https://www.rcsb.org/) to download structural data, and can load structure files from your local storage.

#### `fetch`ing structures from RCSB/PDB

We will download a structure directly from [RCSB/PDB](https://www.rcsb.org/). To do this we will use the **interactive command window**. We also need to know the RCSB/PDB accession for the structure we want to view. Here, we will use the structure [`4I61`](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/4I61), a trimer of PduB, a bacterial microcompartment protein.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## PduB makes biochemical factories inside cells.

[PduB](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/F8DQ39/entry) is a protein that trimerises to form a structural unit that then combines with other similar structural units to enclose a volume within bacterial cells, to make a kind of "factory" for chemical reactions.

The UniProt entry for the protein corresponding to this structure is [F8DQ39](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/F8DQ39/entry)
:::

To `fetch` this structure from RCSB/PDB, we enter the command `fetch 4I61` into the command prompt, and hit `Return` (@fig-pymol_fetch_cmd).

![`PyMOL` command prompt including `fetch` command.](assets/images/pymol/02-pymol_fetch.png){#fig-pymol_fetch_cmd width=75%}

Executing this command will produce a short report to the interactive command window, and show a rendering of the structure in the **main viewer window** (@fig-pymol_fetch_load).

![Initial render of `4I61` PduB structure in `PyMOL`.](assets/images/pymol/03-pymol_fetch_load.png){#fig-pymol_fetch_load width=75%}

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## `PyMOL` downloads the fetched file.

When executed, this command will also download the file `4I61.cif` to the current working directory. You can load this file into `PyMOL` without requiring a live network connection.

## Changing the appearance of the structure

### Rotating the molecule

By default, left-clicking on the molecule in the main viewer window and moving your mouse will rotate the molecule. You can use this to obtain a viewing position that helps you understand the structure better or that, when saved as a figure, will communicate your message to a reader.

### Changing molecule colours

The **object control panel** provides buttons (`A`, `S`, `H`, `L`, `C`) that control aspects of the molecule's appearance:

- `A`/Action
- `S`/Show
- `H`/Hide
- `L`/Label
- `C`/Colour

There are three distinct protein chains in this trimeric structure. We will colour the protein differently by chain so that we can see them more clearly.

::: {.callout-important}
- Click on the `C` button for `4I61` in the **object control panel**
- Click on `by chain` in the menu that appears
- Click on `by chain` in the new menu
:::

This colours each chain in the structure differently, and also the water molecules (small dots) associated with each chain  (@fig-pymol_by_chain).

![`PyMOL` rendering of `4I61` with a different colour for each chain.](assets/images/pymol/04-pymol_by_chain.png){#fig-pymol_by_chain width=75%}

### Hiding elements of the structure

We sometimes want to focus attention on particular parts of a structure. To aid in this we can _hide_ parts of the visualisation, using the `H`/Hide menu in the object control panel.

For example, to hide the water molecules that surround each chain, we would:

::: {.callout-important}
- Click on the `H` button for `4I61` in the object control panel
- Click on `waters`
:::

This removes the water molecules from our visualisation (@fig-pymol_hide_waters).

![`4I61` structure with waters removed.](assets/images/pymol/05-pymol_hide_waters.png){#fig-pymol_hide_waters width=75%}

### Selecting part of the structure

It is possible to select parts of the structure in `PyMOL` by pointing and clicking using the mouse. For complicated selections especially, this can be difficult, tedious, and error-prone. It is usually better to use the **interactive command window** to select structural components explicitly.

#### Selecting with `indicate`

Wo select only the first chain of the trimeric PduB structure (chain A), we could execute the command `indicate chain A`, which highlights that chain in the main visualisation window, to show that it is selected (@fig-pymol_chain_highlight).

::: {callout-note}
See that using `indicate` has produced a new row in the **object control panel** called `(indicate)`. This allows us to control the appearance of the selected element.
:::

![`4I61` structure with chain A highlighted.](assets/images/pymol/06-pymol_chain_highlight.png){#fig-pymol_chain_highlight width=75%}

With the chain selected, we can then change the way it is drawn using the `S`/Show menu for the `(indicate)` selection, and the colours used for rendering, using the corresponding `C`/Colour menu (@fig-pymol_show_spheres, @fig-pymol_colour_spheres).

![Rendering `4I61` chain A structure as spheres.](assets/images/pymol/07-pymol_show_spheres.png){#fig-pymol_show_spheres width=75%}

::: {.callout-important}
Click on the `(indicate)` label in the object control panel to cancel the selection.
:::

#### Selecting specific residues with the sequence viewer

Below the mouse action legend on the right hand side of the window there is a set of control buttons. To the right of this list is a button labelled with the letter `S`. Clicking this button brings up the sequence viewer/selector at the top of the main image visualisation window (@fig-pymol_seq_selector).

![Activating the sequence selector.](assets/images/pymol/09-pymol_seq_selector.png){#fig-pymol_seq_selector width=75%}

The scroll bar below the sequence allows you to find any part of the protein sequence (and additional molecules in the structure). The symbols are coloured to match the current structural representation, to aid with locating specific residues. For instance, in @fig-pymol_selecting_residues the residues for chain `B` are coloured in cyan. Residues can be selected by clicking and dragging within the displayed sequence, and the current selection is highlighted as `(sele)` in the object control panel. We can also select discontinuous sections of the structure, as in @fig-pymol_discontinuous_selection.
