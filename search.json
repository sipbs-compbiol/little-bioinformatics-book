This is an online book, under continual development, which I am building as and when topics come to mind or prominence.\nMy goal is that this online book will come to be a fairly transparent and honest reference for students in bioinformatics, and maybe for some researchers, too.\nI would be very grateful for feedback by email or through the GitHub repository Issues page"
