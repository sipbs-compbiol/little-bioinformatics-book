    "text": "How does MAFFT work?\n\nMultiple workflows, tuned for different circumstances\nMAFFT can be used as a “black box” alignment tool, but it offers several ways to combine its components. The various combinations can be chosen to suit your alignment task or available hardware, and fall into three main categories:\n\nFFT-NS1, FFT-NS-2: progressive methods for large sequence sets\nThese approaches are simple progressive alignment workflows that take advantage of 6-tuple scoring to speed up initial distance matrix construction, and FFTs to speed up sequence and sequence group alignment.\n\nA guide tree is constructed from 6-tuple similarity scores\nA progressive alignment is performed on the guide tree (and the output alignment returned - FFT-NS-1)\nThe guide tree is reconstructed from this alignment (FFT-NS-2)\nThe sequences are realigned against the rebuilt guide tree (and the output alignment returned - FFT-NS-2)\n\nFFT-NS-2 is the default MAFFT algorithm, chosen to balance speed and accuracy (Katoh and Toh 2008a).\n\n\nFFT-NS-i: progressive method for more accurate alignments of smaller sequence sets\nThis approach resembles that for FFT-NS-2, but iterates over guide tree reconstruction and sequence realignment until either no improvement can be detected in the alignment (by Weighted Sum of Pairs, WSP), or a maximum number of iterations is reached.\n\nA guide tree is constructed from 6-tuple similarity scores\nA progressive alignment is performed on the guide tree\nThe guide tree is reconstructed from this alignment\nThe sequences are realigned against the rebuilt guide tree\nSteps 3 and 4 are repeated until there is no improvement in the alignment’s WSP score, or a maximum number of iterations is reached\n\n\n\nL-INS-i, E-INS-i, and G-INS-i: consistency scores for difficult alignment cases\nThese approaches resemble FT-NS-i in that they iterate over guide tree construction and realignment, but differ in that they carry out all-vs-all pairwise alignment initially, rather than the 6-tuple approximation, and employ a COFFEE-like consistency score alongside the WSP score, and different alignment algorithms during pairwise alignment.\n\nE-INS-i uses a global Needleman-Wunsch approach to pairwise alignment, and is suited for alignments between sequences that may have several alignable domains and a high proportion of non-alignable insertions.\nL-INS-i uses a local Smith-Waterman alignment to improve alignments where there is a single alignable domain, with non-alignable flanking sequence.\nG-INS-i uses a global Needleman-Wunsch alignment approach, and is suited to situations where it can be assumed that the entire sequence can be aligned for all inputs.\n\n\n\n\nPairwise sequence, or sequence group alignment\n\nFast Fourier Transform speed-up\nMAFFT improves on the speed of simpler progressive alignment approaches (Feng and Doolittle 1987) by using efficient algorithms to target slow steps in the process. The main advance, which gives MAFFT its name, was to use the fast Fourier Transform (FFT) - an algorithm that converts a signal from one quantitative domain, such as time, to a representation in the frequency domain - to speed up alignment of protein sequences.\nA key insight was to note that the frequency of amino acid substitutions is often determined by whether the substituting residue conserves important physicochemical properties (Katoh et al. 2002). Conservation of such properties is a feature of neutral or near-neutral substitutions. In the original paper, each amino acid (\\(a\\)) was assigned to a vector of two values, one representing the amino acid residue’s volume (\\(v(a)\\)), and one representing its polarity (\\(p(a)\\)), normalised to zero mean and unit variance over all amino acids.\nBy converting the amino acid sequences to be aligned to a sequence of these vectors, MAFFT calculates the correlation between sequences in terms of their polarity and volume components. In doing this, MAFFT considers a positional lag of \\(k\\) sites in the sequence - a parameter controlling the size of sequence region being considered, and the overall correlation is reported for this value, as \\(c(k)\\). By using a fast Fourier Transform for this operation, the CPU time for a set of \\(N\\) input sequences is reduced from \\(O(N^2)\\) to \\(O(N log N)\\).\nThis concept can be extended from an alignment between two sequences to an alignment between two already-aligned groups of sequences, by replacing the vector of volume (or polarity) values for a single sequence with a vector that is the linear combination of the volume components for the aligned group (Katoh et al. 2002).\n\n\nFinding homologous sequence segments\nIf a pair of sequences has homologous regions - conserving polarity and volume - then there will be a corresponding peak in the graph of \\(c(k)\\). This identifies the positional lag of the match, but not its location. So, to determine the actual location of the match, a sliding window analysis (window size 30) is carried out to identify local homologies for the 20 highest peaks in \\(c(k)\\). A score threshold of 0.7 per site is applied, and any window with a higher value is considered a homologous segment. Successive segments identified as homologous segments are combined, to a maximum of 150 sites per homolgous segment. Segments longer than this are divided into segments of maximum length 150 (Katoh et al. 2002).\n\n\nAligning sequence pairs\nA matrix of homologous segments between two sequences is constructed, and the alignment obtained by the standard dynamic programming procedure (Katoh et al. 2002).\n\n\nApplication to nucleotide sequences\nFor nucleotide sequences, rather than using vectors that represent amino acid side chain properties, four-dimensional vectors of A, C, G, T are used at each column. Otherwise the process is identical (Katoh et al. 2002).\n\n\n\nScoring scheme\nMAFFT departs from the common approach of using an all-positive-value scoring matrix, instead adopting a normalised similarity matrix. By default, this was originally derived from a 200 PAM log-odds matrix for both protein and nucleotide alignments, and a simplified gap penalty scheme was also employed (Katoh et al. 2002). More recently, the 200 PAM matrix has been replaced as default by BLOSUM62, and the gap penalty scheme was heavily revised (Katoh and Toh 2008a).\n\n\nGuide tree building\nThe modified UPGMA tree building method used in the original version of MAFFT did not scale well to very large sequence sets, and was replaced in v6 onwards by the PartTree algorithm (Katoh and Toh 2008a, 2008b). This constructs an approximate tree from unaligned sequences by partitioning the dataset and is \\(O(N log N)\\) rather than \\(O(N^2)\\), like UPGMA.\n\n\nRNA and protein alignment incorporating structural information\nIn MAFFT v6, options were introduced to include structural information when aligning RNA sequences. This takes base pairing probability into account, and applies a novel four-way alignment consistency function (Katoh and Toh 2008a).\nMAFFT v7 introduced the ability to inform an alignment by using the ASH structural alignment program and, in particular, the inter-residue distance between alpha carbons for amino acids in the alignment. This is likely to be most useful when aligning sequence-diverse, but structurally similar, proteins (Katoh and Standley 2013).\nMAFFT has been integrated with the DASH structural alignment database, to use structural alignment information as a set of constraints on sequence alignment. This integration is available through the official MAFFT alignment server (Rozewicki et al. 2019).\n\n\nExtension of existing alignments with new sequences\nFurther improvements were introduced in MAFFT v7 to enable addition of unaligned sequences into an existing multiple sequence alignment (Katoh and Standley 2013).\n\n\nParallelisation\nThreading was added to MAFFT v7. Progressive alignment method outputs are identical in non-threaded and threaded runs, but iterative refinement-based alignments may generate different output when threaded (Katoh and Standley 2013)."
